# RPG Playground
 ~ The repository name is wrong -- will fix! This is a work in progress! ~
## What is this?
* It's an 2D role playing game builder, a playground of sorts, for game development on web browsers.
* Built using React and Canvas

## Why aren't you using a game engine to build a game?!
1. For the purpose of learning and experience building a browser-based game from mostly scratch.
2. Canvas is a piece of tech I've been interested to learn more about so this seemed like a good excuse for it.
3. There are existing JavaScript game engines out there, but I was unsatisfied after trying out a number of them.
4. Most game engines require using a different language. I'm quite open to learning other programming languages, but I really like JavaScript and it's the language I feel most comfortable with when coding. Let's just say I felt lazy and didn't want to leave my comfort zone for this particular project. :P
